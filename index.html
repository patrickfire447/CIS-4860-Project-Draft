                    <h3>Project Methodology Explanation</h3>
                    <p>Predictive approach would be my methodology. My project goes over what employees of steam do, showing both the pros and cons. Listing the pros and cons also show what my flaws are in my project, adding necessary changes before delivering it. My project's data is also quite predictable making it easy to absorb.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Project Tool Selection Explanation</h3>
                    <p>My diagram effectively demonstrates the core principles of a predictive project management methodology through its structured, sequential approach to the Steam Services skill acquisition study. The top portion shows the waterfall flow template with distinct phases (Initiate, Plan, Execute, Close) that must be completed in order, with each phase having defined tasks and deliverables.</p>
                    
                    <p>My diagram follows a sequential flow establishing foundational elements like the stakeholder identification and skill acquisition metrics. Learning about stakeholders and skill acquisition before moving into my planning phase helps me focus on creating a framework for the phases I will use for my project.</p>
                    
                    <p>The bottom timeline portion shows a fixed time in which I will work on the project. It might be hard with my current work schedule from Fridays - Sundays, but I can work with it. As long as I have a fixed schedule for a weekly basis I can set milestones and activities to dedicate myself to researching, collecting data, and creating analysis periods.</p>
